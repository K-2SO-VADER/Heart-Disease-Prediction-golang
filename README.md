# Heart Disease (AI Class Project)

For AI class Project, this group will develop a predictive Heart Disease model based on UCI ML dataset You can download the dataset at: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease)

## Setting up the Environment

1. Programming Language: golang 1.7+
1. Visual Studio Code

### Setting up golang

Follow the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Training and Prediction

## [golearn](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn)

- A Machine Learning Library for golang based on [scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)

## How to run

```bash

go run *.go -a <algorithim> -p /path/to/dataset.csv

```

Where algorithm is either crossfold, decision_tree or knn

## Datasets

These are available in the datasets folder
